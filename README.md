# Feedback-UI
This small project was tutorial guided with my own finishing touches.
I was able to learn more on arrow functions and DOM manipulation.
In this project I used HTML for the layout of the page, CSS to style the page and 
vanilla javaScript to manipulate the output based on the feedback given by the user.
